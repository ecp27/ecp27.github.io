#introduction(
  title: [European Coaching Program],
  strapline: [Developing barbershop coaches across Europe],
  summary: [
    The European Coaching Program (ECP) will train and certify barbershop
    coaches from all over Europe. Our aim is to develop experienced coaches into
    world-class coaches. This will further strengthen barbershop expertise in
    Europe and make it easier for quartets and choruses to access high-level
    coaching.

#upcoming-dates(
  (date: [End of September 2026], event: [Selection team announced]),
  (date: [1–15 November 2026], event: [Applications open]),
  (date: [15 December 2026], event: [Candidates selected]),
)

#callout(title: [Applications open soon!])[
  Apply from 1–15 November 2026. #link("#applications")[See application details →]

= Program <program>

In the ECP, experienced barbershop coaches will deepen their mastery of
coaching techniques. The Coaching Candidates will learn to assess the strengths and growth
opportunities of an ensemble, give positive feedback, set priorities, choose
impactful interventions, communicate clearly, run an effective coaching
session, and conduct themselves as coaches.

The ECP is a two-year training program that consists of the following elements:

#program-components[
  #program-component(title: [European Harmony Academy])[
    Candidates will attend the new Advanced Coaching Stream at the
    #link("https://www.barbershop.de/en/veranstaltungen/eha")[European Harmony Academy]
    in August 2027 and August 2028. They will learn coaching techniques
    from world-class faculty, practice with quartets attending EHA,
    and reflect together on their experiences.
  ]

  #program-component(title: [Coaching practice])[
    Candidates will actively coach quartets and choruses on their own time.
    Each candidate will coach at least five groups per year and receive feedback
    through an online form.
  ]

  #program-component(title: [Apprenticeship])[
    Candidates will serve as a coaching apprentice at one or more Harmony College
    or comparable events. Coaching apprentices observe an experienced coach, discuss
    the mentor's coaching style, and get opportunities to coach groups themselves
    and receive feedback from the mentor.
  ]

  #program-component(title: [Mentoring])[
    Each candidate will be assigned an international world-class coach as a personal mentor.
    Candidates will meet their mentors several times a year through video calls.
    They are encouraged to share coaching videos and discuss them with the mentor.
  ]


  #program-component(title: [Online classes])[
    Every few months, all Candidates will meet for exclusive online classes from
    world-class faculty to learn about specialized topics in coaching practice.
    This will include training in the BHS scoring categories, so ECP coaches
    can recognize opportunities for development that will actually increase an
    ensemble's scores.
  ]


  #program-component(title: [Peer review])[
    Candidates will team up in pairs to give each other regular feedback and
    discuss their experiences and possible coaching challenges with each other.
  ]
]




= Applications <applications>

== Who should apply

The ECP is intended for people who already coach quartets or choruses and
have a solid knowledge of the barbershop style.
We are looking for motivated and enthusiastic people who are eager
to learn and grow as coaches.

We deeply appreciate barbershoppers who want to take first steps towards
becoming a coach, but the ECP is not the program for them. The national
barbershop societies regularly offer Harmony College courses and Coaching
Observer opportunities that support new coaches on their journey.

Note that while attendance at the ECP itself is free, Candidates are expected
to attend two European Harmony Academies. Including travel, this may generate
costs of approximately € 3000 over the two years. We encourage Candidates to
seek financial support from their national barbershop societies.


== How to apply

The deadline for applications is 15 November 2026. We will link to a Google
Form from this website.

The application will include coaching videos and written questions about
coaching experience, approach and motivation. Shortlisted applicants will
be interviewed online.

Applications are assessed by an international selection team. The main
criteria are current coaching ability, barbershop knowledge, and willingness
to learn.



= Certification

Candidates will be examined by the selection team before they can graduate
as Certified Coaches.

After the first year, each Candidate will meet with a member of the selection team
for a mid-term checkin. The Candidate and selection team member will review
a video of the Candidate's coaching together and discuss the feedback from the
groups and the Candidate's own experiences. This This results in an
individual development plan for the second year.

Final interviews take place in summer to autumn 2029. Each Candidate will have
video calls with two selection team members to assess their coaching skills and
their understanding of the coach's role. These interviews will involve more
review of coaching videos and feedback.

The successful Candidates will become Certified Coaches in the second half of 2029.

Coaching videos and application material will be handled as described in our
#link("/legal/#privacy")[privacy notice].

= Background

The European Coaching Program is modeled after the BinG! Coaching Certification
Program, which ran in 2019-2023. Our aim is to streamline and improve over the
elements that made the CCP a success and make it attractive to Candidates from
all across Europe. We list the BinG! Certified Coaches of 2023 as a reference for
the level of Candidate the ECP is aimed at.
